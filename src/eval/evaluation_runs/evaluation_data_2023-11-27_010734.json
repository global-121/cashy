        "answer": "I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a specific answer to your question as the given context does not relate to the barriers to decarbonization. The context provided is about defining key performance indicators for a project, creating a solution architecture for an AI system, and establishing a baseline performance level. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question?",
        "ground_truths": [
            " The key barriers to decarbonization are 1. Lack of abundant and affordable green electricity and greenhydrogen, 2: Limited availability of high-grade iron ore suitable for the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) decarbonisation route, 3: shortage of a skilled workforce to support the decarbonisation transition across the value chain, 4: Limited capital available to invest in decarbonisation solutions, 5: uncertainty of sufficient and long-term demand for green steel with green premiums."
